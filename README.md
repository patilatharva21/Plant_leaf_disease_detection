## Plant leaf disease detection system

This project focuses on developing an innovative solution for farmers to easily diagnose plant diseases through image analysis. It begins with the collection of a comprehensive dataset of healthy and diseased leaf images, sourced from platforms such as the Kaggle dataset PlantVillage Dataset. The dataset is crucial for training a convolutional neural network (CNN) model capable of accurately classifying various plant diseases. The CNN model is meticulously trained to differentiate between healthy leaves and those affected by specific diseases, leveraging advanced image processing and deep learning techniques to achieve high accuracy in predictions.
